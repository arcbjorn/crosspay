# CrossPay Protocol Security Documentation

## Security Architecture Overview

CrossPay Protocol implements a multi-layered security model combining:
- **Zama FHE** for cryptographic privacy
- **Symbiotic Validators** for consensus security  
- **Risk-Stratified Vaults** for economic security
- **Role-Based Access Control** for operational security

## Threat Model

### Assets at Risk
1. **User Funds**: ETH and ERC20 tokens in escrow
2. **Validator Stakes**: Bonded ETH securing the network
3. **Vault Deposits**: Risk-tranched liquidity pools
4. **Private Data**: Encrypted payment amounts and metadata

### Attack Vectors
1. **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**: Reentrancy, overflow, access control
2. **Cryptographic Attacks**: FHE key compromise, signature forgery
3. **Validator Attacks**: Collusion, censorship, griefing
4. **Economic Attacks**: Vault manipulation, slashing abuse
5. **Privacy Attacks**: Disclosure bypass, correlation analysis

## Security Assumptions

### Cryptographic Assumptions
- Zama FHE scheme remains secure against chosen-plaintext attacks
- ECDSA signatures cannot be forged without private key knowledge
- Ethereum's consensus layer provides finality guarantees
- Random number generation is unpredictable and unbiased

### Network Assumptions  
- At least 67% of validators are honest and responsive
- Network partitions resolve within validation timeout periods
- Smart contract execution environment is not compromised
- Oracle data feeds remain accurate and manipulation-resistant

### Economic Assumptions
- Validator slashing penalties exceed potential attack profits
- Vault participants act rationally to maximize risk-adjusted returns
- Gas costs make spam attacks economically infeasible
- Token price stability prevents manipulation of yield calculations

## Security Controls

### Access Control Matrix

| Role | ConfidentialPayments | RelayValidator | TrancheVault | Analytics |
|------|---------------------|----------------|--------------|-----------|
| DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE | Pause, role mgmt | Pause, thresholds | Pause, fees | - |
| COMPLIANCE_ROLE | Emergency disclosure | - | - | - |
| AUDITOR_ROLE | Request disclosure | - | - | Read-only |
| VALIDATOR_ROLE | - | Sign validations | - | - |
| Owner | Contract admin | Slash, validation | Vault admin | - |

### Input Validation
- All user addresses validated against zero address
- Payment amounts checked for minimum thresholds
- Signature verification before processing
- Deadline enforcement on time-sensitive operations
- Tranche deposit limits enforced

### State Protection
- ReentrancyGuard on all external state-changing functions
- Pausable emergency stops across all contracts
- Overflow protection via Solidity 0.8+ built-ins
- Safe ERC20 transfers to handle non-standard tokens

## Known Limitations

### Zama FHE Privacy
- Encrypted amounts revealed during contract execution for transfers
- Homomorphic operations limited to addition/comparison
- Client-side encryption keys must be managed securely
- Gas costs significantly higher for encrypted operations

### Validator Network
- Requires minimum 3 validators for basic security
- No protection against coordinated 67%+ validator attacks
- Signature aggregation increases gas costs linearly with validators
- Network assumes honest majority without stake weighting

### Tranche Vault
- Slashing waterfall may not fully cover extreme losses
- Yield calculations vulnerable to flash loan manipulation
- No protection against coordinated vault drain attacks
- Rebalancing requires manual intervention

## Emergency Procedures

### Incident Response Plan
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring alerts on anomalous behavior
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate severity and potential impact
3. **Containment**: Activate emergency pause on affected contracts
4. **Recovery**: Execute recovery procedures based on incident type
5. **Post-Mortem**: Document lessons learned and update controls

### Emergency Controls
- `emergencyPause()` on all contracts halts operations
- `slashValidator()` removes malicious validators
- `emergencyCancel()` refunds grant pools if needed
- Multi-sig admin controls prevent single points of failure

### Recovery Mechanisms
- Time-locked withdrawals allow dispute resolution
- Insurance fund covers small slashing events
- Validator exit mechanisms prevent forced participation
- Disclosure controls balance privacy with compliance

## Audit Checklist

- [ ] External calls handled safely with proper error handling
- [ ] Emergency pause mechanisms tested
- [ ] Upgrade mechanisms secured with time locks

### Cryptographic Security  
- [ ] FHE operations audited by Zama team
- [ ] Signature verification logic reviewed
- [ ] Key management procedures documented
- [ ] Randomness sources evaluated for bias
- [ ] Privacy guarantees formally verified

### Economic Security
- [ ] Game theory analysis of validator incentives

## Invariants

### Contract Invariants
- Total vault assets always equal sum of tranche balances plus insurance fund
- Validator stake always matches on-chain balance
- Payment escrow balance equals sum of pending payment amounts
- Encrypted balances can only be revealed through authorized disclosure

### System Invariants  
- Active validator count never drops below minimum threshold
- Validation requests expire within configured timeout
- Slashing always follows waterfall order (Junior → Mezzanine → Senior)
- Privacy settings cannot be retroactively modified

## Deployment Security

### Contract Deployment
- Use deterministic deployment for consistent addresses
